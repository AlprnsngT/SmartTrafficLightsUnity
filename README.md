# SmartTrafficLightsUnity

The aim of this project is to develop an intelligent traffic light system by detecting vehicle density at intersections and optimizing the timing of traffic lights. The project aims to create a solution using image processing and optimization techniques to minimize waiting times for vehicles at intersections with various structures and complexities.

## Project Objectives
Utilizing image processing techniques to detect vehicle density at intersections.
Optimizing red and green light timings to enhance traffic flow.
Developing an intelligent traffic light system suitable for various types of intersections.
Focusing on organizing traffic lights and optimizing traffic flow.

## How It Works
This project employs image processing and optimization techniques to detect vehicle density at intersections and optimize traffic flow. The project is designed to cover various types of intersections and is optimized to minimize waiting times for vehicles.

## Usage
1. This project is available on my GitHub account. You can review and run the project by following these steps:
2. Clone the project from GitHub: git clone https://github.com/AlprnsngT/SmartTrafficLightsUnity.git
